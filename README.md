# Card-collection-JSF

Simple JSF project made for university classes. Project combines functionalities of collectible card games and websites that allow users to share their collections.
Users after registration gain some amount of cardscraps that they can use to craft cards and randomly chosen 5 cards. They can add cards to their collection (by crafting them) or destroy them and gain cardscraps.
They can also look at other users collections, or report their ideas of cards. E-mail and password can be changed after clicking on avatar. Administrators can delete user accounts, change card values or add new cards to app.

Unfortunately, JSF isn't the best option to choose for web app but it was required for that project. After many hours of configuration I couldn't manage to make file upload work, so adding any pictures is currently unavailable. Also I'm aware that not every component contains validation, but university classes have ended and I don't think that I will write in JSF again.
